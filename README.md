# SpaceWar

This is a Spacewar version for the PDP8. Originally it was written by Evan Suits for the LAB8  and AX08.

This was the only SpaceWar version which I could find for a PDP8 which doesn't need the EAE (Extended Arithmetic Extension). Many people do not have these EAE boards. And other people simply ran out of expansion slots in their systems... So I've updated this SpaceWar! version to use it with standard OmniBus cards.

Hardware needed:
PDP8 (/E /F /M /A) 
VC8E (M869/M855)
DK8EA (M882) 
DR8EA (M863) (Optional for the PDP /E /F /M)

I might make some more updates to this version. If you have some comments then please sent me a message.

A schematic is placed to connect the optional Joysticks.

Regards, Roland
